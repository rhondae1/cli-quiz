        <h3>The Funeral Poetry of My Sister,  Gerald Stern,  1925 </h3>

        <div class="poem">Since there was no mother for the peach tree <span class="mom">we did it all alone</span>, which made the two of us closer though closeness brought its loneliness, and it would have been better I think sometimes to be sterile from the start just
          to avoid the pain which in my life this far has lasted seventy years for I am in love with a skeleton on whose small bones a dress hung for a while, on whose small skull a bit of curly hair was strung, and what is dust I still don’t know since
          there was no mother to turn to then and ask what else was she wearing, did she have on shoes, and were the two trees from Georgia, and was it true somebody said the other peach should have died instead of her; and I could imagine the nose going
          first though forty years later the trees were still there and not as big as you’d think; and it was my cousin Red with the flabby lips who said it, he had red eyes, a red monstrosity, a flabby body, half the house was filled with male cousins,
          they were born in rooms a short distance from the rats, I can’t remember which ones had the accents nor what his Hebrew name was, nor his English.

          <h3>Sonnet [Nothing was ever what it claimed to be,] Karen Volkman</h3>


          <div class="poem">Nothing was ever what it claimed to be, the earth, blue egg, in its seeping shell dispensing damage like a hollow hell inchling weeping for a minor sea</div>

          <div class="poem">ticking its tidelets, x and y and z. The blue beneficence we call and spell and call blue heaven, the whiteblue well of constant water, deepening a thee,</div>

          <div class="poem">a thou and who, touching every what— and in the or, a shudder in the cut— and that you are, blue mirror, only stare</div>

          <div class="poem">bluest blankness, whether in the where, sheen that bleeds blue beauty we are <span class="mom">taught drowns and booms and vowels.</span> I will not.</div>
